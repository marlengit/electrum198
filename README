Electrum - lightweight Bitcoin client
CUSTOM VERSION maintained at https://github.com/marlengit/electrum198

includes features:
Receive only tab - this tab only shows fresh addresses
Bulk signing feature - this will sign many transactions with one password entry
Scatter feature - 

The Scatter feature works as a background process which automatically 
creates and broadcasts single input transactions from addresses with 
balances over a user specified amount and sends them to fresh addresses. 
It continues to automate spending into the same wallet breaking address 
balances down into smaller and smaller amounts until all address 
balances are below the scatter limit. 

The transactions are not broadcasted immediately but are saved into 
transaction files and broadcasted at random times. For cold wallets 
transaction files are unsigned so need to be taken to the cold wallet, 
bulk signed then returned to the scatter folder for broadcasting. 
The purpose of Scatter is to assist with privacy by keeping the address 
balances dynamic via single input trasnactions.
 
All scatter transactions are single input only for privacy. 
If unspent outputs are sent via single input transactions 
analyses to find the source of the transactions becomes a lot harder. 

If/when down the spend tree a multiple input transaction is used that can 
spoil the privacy effect. So the scatter feature is meant support avoiding
any multiple input transactions from occurring, ever.

Since the scatter transactions will split unspent outputs above the 
"scatter limit" and send the max of unspent outputs (minus fee) below 
the "scatter limit" then there will be lots of addresses in the wallet 
with small unspent outputs. This is good for privacy. 

But at some point down the line the user, in order to perform a large 
transaction would need to build a multiple input transaction thereby 
spoiling some privacy. 

To avoid this I am creating a "Slow Send via Scatter" feature which will
break up a send into multiple single input transactions to fill up a 
target address (frozen) slowly over time to the desired balance via the 
scatter process i.e. via multiple single input transactions broadcasted 
at random intervals. Once the desired balance is reached another single 
input transaction can spend the large balance. 

I'm not sure how rock solid this kind of privacy is but it will 
certainly complicate efforts to analyze ownership of addresses.

Because scatter transactions are not broadcast immediately there are 
scatter variables which keep track of which addresses have been used 
as inputs/outputs in unbroadcasted scatter transactions and new scatter 
transactions will not be made until the whole batch is broadcasted. 
The quantity of transactions in a scatter batch is restricted by the 
gap limit.
